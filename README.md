# MCP Chatbot: Multi-Level Academic Research Assistant

## ðŸ¤– Project Overview

This Chatbot is an advanced, multi-tool powered by MCP. It got the ability to retreive academic research and paper exploration from arXiv, building analysis, summarizing papers, save the output locally and retreive local files. 

## ðŸ“š Key Featuress

- **Four chatbots classified by complexity **: 
  - `chatbot_lvl1_tools.py`: Basic Chatbot functionality with tools to interact with arxiv
  - `chatbot_lvl2_mcp_v2.py`: Enhanced Chatbot capabilities with MCP (2 tools from arxiv)
  - `chatbot_lvl3_multi_mcp.py`: Advanced Chatbot with multi MCP servers (adding fetch, Github & filesystem)
  - `chatbot_lvl4.py`: Advanced Chatbot multi-model processing with external MCP servers (adding prompts & resources)

- **MCP servers Integration**:

  - Arxiv in `arxiv_tools_4_chatbot.py`: Seamless research paper retrieval and analysis, to Search and extract information from academic repositories, Support for in-depth paper exploration
  - filesystem : Secure file operations with configurable access controls
  - Github : Tools to read, search, and manipulate Git repositories
  - Prompts: Search for papers, extract and organize the information then Provide a comprehensive summary
  - Resources: give access to "papers://folders" (papers retreived from Arxiv )
