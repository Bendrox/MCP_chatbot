# Summary of Academic Papers on Model Context Protocol

## 1. A survey of agent interoperability protocols: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP)
- **Authors**: Abul Ehtesham, Aditi Singh, Gaurav Kumar Gupta, Saket Kumar
- **Published**: May 4, 2025
- **Summary**: This survey examines four emerging agent communication protocols, including the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP provides a JSON-RPC client-server interface for secure tool invocation and typed data exchange. The paper compares these protocols across multiple dimensions and proposes a phased adoption roadmap, beginning with MCP for tool access, followed by other protocols for more complex agent interactions. The work provides a comprehensive foundation for designing secure, interoperable, and scalable ecosystems of LLM-powered agents.

## 2. Key Exchange Protocol in the Trusted Data Servers Context
- **Authors**: Quoc-Cuong To, Benjamin Nguyen, Philippe Pucheral
- **Published**: September 11, 2015
- **Summary**: This technical report proposes a Group Key Exchange protocol enabling Queriers and Trusted Data Servers (TDSs) to securely create and exchange shared keys. The paper formally proves the security of this protocol using a game-based model and compares it with related works. While not directly focused on Model Context Protocol, it addresses secure data exchange in distributed systems which is relevant to the context protocols space.

## 3. Systematic Mapping Protocol: Reasoning Algorithms on Feature Model
- **Authors**: Samuel Sep√∫lveda, Marcelo Esperguel
- **Published**: March 26, 2021
- **Summary**: This paper defines a protocol for conducting a systematic mapping study on reasoning algorithms for feature modeling in software product lines. While it focuses on protocol development for research methodology rather than on Model Context Protocol specifically, it demonstrates the importance of standardized protocols in complex technical domains for managing variability and ensuring consistency.

## 4. Recipe: Hardware-Accelerated Replication Protocols
- **Authors**: Dimitra Giantsidi, Emmanouil Giortamis, Julian Pritzi, Maurice Bailleu, Manos Kapritsos, Pramod Bhatotia
- **Published**: February 13, 2025
- **Summary**: This paper introduces Recipe, a novel approach to transforming Crash Fault Tolerant (CFT) protocols to operate securely in Byzantine settings. While not directly about Model Context Protocol, it addresses related concerns of protocol security, consistency, and performance in distributed systems. The approach leverages modern cloud hardware, including many-core servers, RDMA-capable networks, and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enhance protocol security and performance in untrusted environments.

## 5. Model Context Protocols in Adaptive Transport Systems: A Survey
- **Authors**: Gaurab Chhetri, Shriyank Somvanshi, Md Monzurul Islam, Shamyo Brotee, Mahmuda Sultana Mimi, Dipti Koirala, Biplov Pandey, Subasish Das
- **Published**: August 26, 2025
- **Summary**: This survey provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a unifying paradigm in adaptive transport systems. It highlights MCP's ability to bridge protocol-level adaptation with context-aware decision making. The paper proposes a five-category taxonomy and reveals that MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables semantic interoperability, particularly for AI-driven transport systems. The authors present a research roadmap positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware, and intelligent transport infrastructures.

## Conclusion

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as a significant innovation in enabling interoperability between AI agents, tools, and systems. As shown in these papers, MCP provides a standardized JSON-RPC based client-server interface that facilitates secure tool invocation and typed data exchange. 

Its applications span various domains, from LLM-powered agent ecosystems to adaptive transport systems. The protocol addresses the critical need for standardization in increasingly complex AI-driven systems where traditional ad-hoc integrations struggle with scaling, security, and cross-domain generalization.

Research indicates that MCP is positioned as an initial step in a broader adoption roadmap for agent interoperability, serving as a foundation upon which more complex interaction protocols can be built. Its client-server structure and focus on semantic interoperability make it particularly well-suited for AI-driven applications where context-awareness and adaptation are essential.
